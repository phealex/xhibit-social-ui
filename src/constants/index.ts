The device would be able to understand and respond to natural language, learn from its user, and even anticipate their needs. It’s a bold vision, but Altman is confident that it’s possible. In a recent interview, he said, “I think we’re at the point where we can start to build things that are genuinely intelligent.” Study: AI helps low performers most Wharton researchers found that generative AI tools significantly enhanced consultants' performance across various tasks, acting as a skill-leveler especially for lower performers.
